/* ============================================================
   STORY EXPANSION — "The Hollow Crown"

   A story mod: it extends the campaign after Chapter V and only
   applies when the game RESTARTS.

   It is written to be picked up mid-run. If your save has already
   finished the base story, loading it drops you straight into
   Chapter VII with the hero, level, gear, gold and quests you
   already have — nothing is reset.

   Adds:
     CHAPTERS     — three new chapters (VII, VIII, IX)
     LOCATIONS    — Hollowmere and the Drowned Choir
     WORLD_POS    — their places on the world map
     ENEMIES      — three new foes (reusing existing art)
     SIDE_QUESTS  — a four-part side chain
     WIKI         — codex entries
