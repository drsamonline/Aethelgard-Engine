/* ============================================================
   EXAMPLE CLASS MOD — adds a whole new playable class.

   A class is an "additive" mod: it applies the moment you enable it
   and it appears in the character-creation screen.

   It shows the four things a class needs:
     CLASSES        — the class itself
     ACTIVE_SKILLS  — its combat skills
     CLASS_MISSIONS — its two personal missions
     WIKI           — codex entries
