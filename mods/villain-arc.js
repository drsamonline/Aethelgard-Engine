   VILLAIN ARC — "The Crown's Shadow"

   A complete role reversal. You are no longer the adventurer: you
   are one of the five things Aethelgard sends heroes to kill.

   An overhaul mod — it changes the campaign, the classes and the
   bestiary, so it only applies when the game RESTARTS. Turn it on
   in Settings and reload; it plays as its own separate game.

   It uses the same art as everything else:
     - the five bosses become PLAYABLE CLASSES (their boss art)
     - the eight hero classes become ENEMIES (their class art)

   Adds:
     CLASSES        — five playable villains
     ACTIVE_SKILLS  — their skills
     CLASS_MISSIONS — their missions
     CHAPTERS       — a five-chapter villain campaign
     ENEMIES        — the heroes, and the Champion who hunts you
     WIKI           — codex entries

     A WHOLE SEPARATE GAME
     Declaring a MODE puts a second choice on the title screen.
     While "Chronicles" is selected this mod contributes NOTHING —
     the base game is untouched. Pick "The Crown's Shadow" and the
     page reloads into the villain campaign, with the eight hero
     classes hidden and only these five playable.

     PLACING THE HEROES IN THE WORLD

     The campaign's objectives are all "kill a hero", but this mod
     only declared the hero enemies — it never put them anywhere, so
     the Village Hunter could not be found and chapter I was
     impossible to finish. These spawns fix that.

     init() runs only while this mode is active, so Chronicles is
     untouched. Each POI is added to the region's existing list, so
     the gathering spots stay.
